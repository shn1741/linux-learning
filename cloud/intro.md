# Cloud Computing – Introduction

## What this lesson covered
An introductory lesson explaining what cloud computing is using a coffee shop analogy, and how cloud services differ from traditional on-premises infrastructure.

## Client–Server Model (Coffee Shop Example)
- The coffee shop represents the service provider
- Customers represent clients
- Customers request coffee (services)
- The shop provides resources on demand

This mirrors how clients request services from servers in computing.

## On-Premises Infrastructure
- Companies buy and maintain their own servers
- Requires upfront hardware costs
- Must handle power, cooling, maintenance, and scaling
- Resources may sit unused during low demand

## Cloud Computing (AWS example)
- Infrastructure is owned and managed by the cloud provider
- Resources are rented instead of owned
- Users pay only for what they use
- Easy to scale up or down based on demand

## Key Concept: Pay Only for What You Use
- No upfront hardware investment
- Costs scale with usage
- More efficient for variable workloads

## Notes / reflections
- The analogy helped clarify the client–server relationship
- Still need to learn how this maps to real AWS services
