# OSI Model – Overview

## What this is
A conceptual model that explains how network communication is divided into layers.

## Layers (top to bottom)
- Application
- Presentation
- Session
- Transport
- Network
- Data Link
- Physical

## Why layers exist
- Separation of concerns
- Easier troubleshooting
- Standardization

## Still unclear
- What exactly happens at each layer
- How this maps to real protocols
